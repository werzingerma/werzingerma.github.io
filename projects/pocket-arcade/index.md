# pocket-arcade

snake, minesweeper, space invaders – for your phone, works offline.

## play

**[→ werzingerma.github.io/pocket-arcade](https://werzingerma.github.io/pocket-arcade/)**

works best on mobile. desktop works too but looks weird.

## install as app

it's a PWA, can be installed like a real app:

**iphone:** safari → share → "add to home screen"
**android:** chrome → menu → "add to home screen"

works offline after that.

## games

- **snake** – swipe controls
- **minesweeper** – tap/long press for flags
- **space invaders** – touch buttons

## why

weekend project to learn PWAs and service workers. the games are simple, the interesting part was the offline caching.

## what's missing

- [ ] highscore persistence
- [ ] sound
- [ ] tetris would be cool
